# python can be used to perform operations on a file.(read and write data)
# type of files ->
# 1) text files -> .txt, .docx, .log etc.
# 2) binary files -> .mp4, .mov, .png, .jpeg etc.

# open, read & close file -> we have to open a file before reading or writing
# eg. -> 
# f = open("fine_name","mode")    #file_bame -> sample.txt,demo.docx     #mode -> r-read mode, w-write mode
# data = f.read()
# f.close()
