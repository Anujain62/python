# A built-in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values.



# for creation of single element tuple
# tup = (1)       #if we write this, so python includs as a integer does not called tuple
# tup = (1,)
# print(type(tup))
# print(tup)


# for creation of multiple elements tuple
tup = (2,1,3,1)

# print(type(tup))
print(tup)



# slicing -> same as list
# print(tup[1:4])
# print(tup[:3])
# print(tup[2:])
# print(tup[-3:-1])



# methods
# returns index of first occurrence
print(tup.index(1))

# counts total occurrences
print(tup.count(1))
