num = 5
print(id(num))         #it prints memory address of num variable.

a = num
print(id(a))        #it prints same address of num variable beacuse here ve assign num variable value inside the variable a.


b = 5
print(id(b))          #it is also prints the same value as it is num variable because value of num variable and value of b variable is same so both are points to same address.
